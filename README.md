## `1995` JAVA

Sun Microsystems developed Java, originally intended to be used with hand-held devices

## `1995` PHP

Rasmus Lerdorf developed PHP, mainly for Web development. PHP continues to be widely used in Web development today

## `1995` Ruby

Yukihiro Matsumoto developed Ruby as an all-purpose programming language, ideal for many programming jobs. Ruby is widely used in the development of Web applications

## `1995` JavaScript

Brendan Eich developed JavaScript to enhance Web browser interactions

## `2000` C#

Microsoft developed C# as a combination of C++ and Visual Basic. C# is similar to Java in some ways

## `2003` Scala

Martin Odersky created Scala as a programing language that combines aspects of functional programming

## `2009` GO
